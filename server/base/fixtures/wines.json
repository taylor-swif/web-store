So much so, that in the most remarkable examples you cannot see the soil for the stones: fist sized, light weight, black volcanic pumice. The word Calderara is reminiscent of “caldera” or “cauldron”, probably due to the fact that the black rocks hold the day’s heat through part of the night.\nCalderara Sottana is a single vineyard wine produced only from vineyards between 50-100 years old. Of all single vineyard wines it is perhaps the most complete: much like a wide angle lens encompasses the most ample panorama, so Calderara seems to contain and display the widest spectrum of flavors, bouquets, nuances. Floral and spicy, leathery and aromatic, it delivers a wonderful filling sensation on the palate, yet stepping lightly.",

Instead Jules prefers a wine with delicate freshness and attractive fruit flavours that express the vineyards in which they were grown. With only 10% new oak and a partial malolactic ferment, this elegant wine that will convert even the most die-hard chardonnay-basher!\nDelicious aromas of red apple and white nectarine are interwoven with grapefruit pith and notes of candied mango. These primary aromas are supported by nougat notes and complex hints of brazil nuts and toffee. This wine is soft and smooth with a lovely polished feel. Plenty of wild fermentation has made it textural and complex whilst retaining fresh, bright acidity. The flavours are mouthfilling and give way to a long, juicy finish.\nTry it with chicken roasted on a bed of lemon and oregano potatoes, or served with a Moroccan couscous salad. Or for a lighter option try it with a farro or cracked wheat salad with roasted tomatoes, broad beans and a tahini dressing.",

This wine generally comes completely from the Ruttars plot but in occasional vintages may include lots of Friulano from Brazzano.\nThis textured, zesty white wine is delicious on its own though extremely food-friendly too-- light enough for vegetables and fish though full enough for chicken and pork.",

Its name literally means sand, which is true to its rugged terroir, where grapes are stressed by intense sun and by cool nights.\nSustainably farmed grapes and the magic of El Arenal produce an incredibly sophisticated tannin structure, and result in a supreme balance of fruit, freshness, power, complexity and elegance that only this extreme altitude has to offer.\nVery deep color, almost black, with purple rerfections. Elegant and complex nose: black fruit (blackberry, cherry), spicy (white pepper) and floral (violet) and mineral notes. Well integrated toasting of the barrels. On the palate it is very fruity, vibrant and concentrated, with good structure and firm tannins. Ageing: 12 months in French Oak Barrels, 6 months in bottle.",

My best description of Hannibal 2011 is that it is the kind of wine which one pulls the cork on while cooking only to discover the bottle is empty before sitting down to dinner. It is perfectly elegant with sufficient “leather” in its taste profile – a reminder of its Italian links. All Barrel matured for sixteen months after fermenting the different grapes separately. This vintage comprises Sangiovese 42%, Nebbiolo 17%, Pinot Noir 15%, Shiraz 12%, Mouvedre 7% and Barbera 7%.

Its classification, one of the oldest in France, goes back to 1937.

After revealing mineral notes on the nose, the wine opens with a perfect balance of alcohol and acidity on the palate.

These wines are made in small quantities and are based on the côtes Cru Classé land that surrounds the town of Saint Emilion. The vineyard is situated next to CLOS FOURTET – separated by a tumble-down wall. We were lucky enough to purchase this vineyard from CHATEAU CANON, Premier Grand Cru Classé.\nLE CARRE exemplifies the fantastic provenance of differing soils/terroirs that Saint Emilion manifests. Only 400 meters separates LES ASTERIES and LE CARRE and yet the wines are poles apart in style. LE CARRE is probably our chunkiest, most modern-style wine.\n94-96 PTS, JEB DUNNUCK: “Coming from a parcel near Clos Fourtet, the 2018 Le Carré (which means “square” in English) is 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc brought up 80% new French. Its purple color is followed by a killer bouquet of cassis and blackcurrants balanced by a terrific sense of minerality and salinity. Full-bodied, deep, layered, and pure, it's the finest vintage to date and is well worth seeking out.”",

The nose is intense, subtly mingling crushed strawberries with white flowers, red cherries, candied pears and a touch of mint. The palate is crisp and fresh, the fruit is beautifully balanced; a full and elegant wine with a refreshing, dry finish. Great persistence.\nMatthew Jukes, 2022\n\"You would have thought Le Dôme would have been owner Jonathan Maltus’s dream, but no. Le Rêve rosé wears this monicker, and Jonathan, an international wine magnate of standing, has made just 500 cases of bottles and 600 magnums of this heavenly wine. This is Maltus’s first foray into rosé, and it is a fleshy, mid-way point between painfully thin Provençal wannabes and the more structured rosés from Bandol, and the quality of the strawberry fruit is second to none. Generous, ambitious and delicious, this dream is now a reality.\"",
